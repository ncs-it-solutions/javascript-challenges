# Challenge #3

Check if a word (string) is palindrome or not.

A word is a palindrome when its reverse is exactly equal to its original form.

## Example

For example, “madam” is a palindrome word because its original and reverse are exactly the same. Similarly, “car” is not a palindrome because its reverse “rac” is not the same as its original value.

## Test

Open terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run test:challenge:3
```
