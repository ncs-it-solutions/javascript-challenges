# Challenge #4

Find the factorial of the given number.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

## Example

If the input is the number 5, the output must be the number 120, because `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`

### Other examples

| n   |                n! |
| --- | ----------------: |
| 0   |                 1 |
| 1   |                 1 |
| 2   |                 2 |
| 3   |                 6 |
| 4   |                24 |
| 5   |               120 |
| 6   |               720 |
| 7   |             5 040 |
| 8   |            40 320 |
| 9   |           362 880 |
| 10  |         3 628 800 |
| 11  |        39 916 800 |
| 12  |       479 001 600 |
| 13  |     6 227 020 800 |
| 14  |    87 178 291 200 |
| 15  | 1 307 674 368 000 |

## Notes

- If the input is a negative number, you can assume as 0 (zero).
