# Challenge #5

Fix the loop bug.

The aim of the loop is to print the number from 1 to 5 on the console, as follows:

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
```

But the loop is printing the following:

```bash
6
6
6
6
6
```

Start by analyzing the algorithm, fix it and explain what was happening.

## Execute the code

Open terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run challenge:5
```
